# Metro System

This project is a C++ implementation of a metro system path finder. It allows users to find the best and optimal route from their source station to their destination station using various algorithms.

## Features

- **Optimal Path Finding**: Calculates the shortest and most efficient path between two metro stations.
- **Expected Fare**: Calculates the expected fare from source to destination.
- **Distance Calculation**: Calculates the distance between the source and destination.

## Algorithms Used

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Used for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Used for traversing the graph and finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
