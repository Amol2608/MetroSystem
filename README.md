# Metro System 
This project is a C++ implementation of a metro system path finder. It allows users to find the best and optimal route from their source station to their destination station using various algorithms.
<br>
Features <br>
Optimal Path Finding: Calculates the shortest and most efficient path between two metro stations.<br> 
Epected Fare : It calculates the expected fair from source to destination . <br>

Algorithms Used <br>
Dijkstra's Algorithm: Used for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.<br>
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Used for traversing the graph and finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.<br>
