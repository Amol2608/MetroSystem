# Metro System 
This project is a C++ implementation of a metro system path finder. It allows users to find the best and optimal route from their source station to their destination station using various algorithms.
<h2>Features</h2> <br>
<h3>Optimal Path Finding:</h3> Calculates the shortest and most efficient path between two metro stations.<br> 
<h3>Expected Fare : </h3> It calculates the expected fair from source to destination . <br>
<h3>Distance :</h3> It calculates the distance  between the source and destination .

<h2>Algorithms Used</h2> <br>
<h3>Dijkstra's Algorithm:</h3> Used for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.<br>
<h3>Breadth-First Search (BFS): </h3> Used for traversing the graph and finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.<br>
